DEAR RECRUITER,

I managed to meet most of the required business targets, but due to illness last week, I ran out of time. 
Because of that, I haven't done responsiveness, even though I have started that and even done something with it.
The second thing that I haven't done was pop-up gallery, but I added some "gallery" effects on images.
I think that if it had not been for the illness that occured, I would have managed to complete the task 100%.
I would be grateful for an opportunity to discuss it further if invited for an interview.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
